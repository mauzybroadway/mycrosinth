Synth project moved over to Eclipse.

A project for class. Due to time restrictions, functionality isn't fully there,
but it plays notes and displays the note/volume on 4x7-seg display. Uses 13-switch
array and rotary encoder on the P24 board provided by Hawkins.

(note to Green Hills: its kind of a mess with few comments, but i figured its a good
project to show due to its relative complexity compared to other school projects. I lost
some of my other projects in this class (problems with a Windows VM, so the USB stuff is missing.
Code from my OS projects is MUCH better, so I will also send some of that...)


TODO:
	Bring over SoundFont logic from other projects...if i can find it...
	USB (working in other version of project)
